# Yourart-tt
[![Tests CI](https://github.com/r-belounis/yourart-tt/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/r-belounis/yourart-tt/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This technical test was realised with a fullstack approach, to respond to the best of making a full product page, with working components.

> Remix was the best choice in mind for developping this test, as the main goal was to reproduce a end-to-end working and pre-production page. The philosophy was set with the free to go for making this test, with the requirements in mind.

## Features

- Fullstack framework approach, to render the product pages
- TailwindCSS and it's associated components libraries to make better UI/UX experience
- UI components tested with Storybook
- Remix routes and loaders tested with jest.
- Written in typescript for less prone to error development

## Tech
This repository uses the latests techs available for frontend development.
- [Remix.run]
Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience.
- [Storybook] 
Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. Thousands of teams use it for UI development, testing, and documentation. Itâ€™s open source and free.
- [Tailwindcss] 
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- [Windui]
Expertly made, responsive, accessible components in React and HTML ready to be used on your website or app. Just copy and paste them on your Tailwind CSS project.
- [Flowbite]
Build websites even faster with components on top of Tailwind CSS
- [Spline]
Spline is an easy to use 3D design tool geared for any designer regardless of their 3D experience.
- [Jest]
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- [Vercel]
Vercel's frontend cloud gives developers the frameworks, workflows, and infrastructure to build a faster, more personalized Web.

## Development
To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.

## Deployment
After having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).
